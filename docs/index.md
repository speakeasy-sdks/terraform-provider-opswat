  MetaDefender Core: ## Developer Guide
  
  This is the API documentation for MetaDefender Core Public API.  If you
  would like to evaluate or have any questions about this documentation,
  please contact us via our Contact Us https://www.opswat.com/contact form.
  
  How to Interact with MetaDefender Core using REST
  Beginning with MetaDefender Core 4.x, OPSWAT recommends using the JSON-based
  REST API. The available methods are documented below.
  Note: MetaDefender API doesn't support chunk upload, however is
  recommended to stream the files to MetaDefender Core as part of the upload
  process.
  
  File Analysis Process
  MetaDefender's main functionality is to analyze large volumes with a high throughput. Depending on the configuration and licensed technologies, the analysis times can vary.
    Below is a brief description of the API integration flow:
  Upload a file for analysis (POST /file), which returns the data_id: File Analysis).
  Note: The performance depends on:
  - number of nodes (scaling)
  - number of engines per node
  - type of file to be scanned
  - Metadefender Core and nodes' hardwareYou have 2 ways to retrieve the analysis report:
  Polling: Fetch the result with previously received dataid (GET /file/{data_id} resource) until scan result belonging to dataid doesn't reach the 100 percent progress_percentage: (Fetch analysis result)
  Note: Too many data_id requests can reduce performance. It is enough to just check every few hundred milliseconds.
  Callbackurl: Specify a callbackurl that will be called once the analysis is complete.Retrieve the analysis results anytime after the analysis is completed with hash for files (md5, sha1, sha256) by calling Fetch analysis result by hash.
  The hash can be found in the scan resultsRetrieve processed file (sanitized, redacted, watermarked, etc.) after the analysis is complete.
  > Note: Based on the configured retention policy, the files might be available for retrieval at a later time.
  
  OPSWAT provides some sample codes on GitHub https://github.com/OPSWAT to
  make it easier to understand how the MetaDefender REST API works.

## How to Interact with MetaDefender Core using REST

Beginning with MetaDefender Core 4.x, OPSWAT recommends using the JSON-based
REST API. The available methods are documented below.

> _**Note**:_ MetaDefender API doesn't support chunk upload, however is
recommended to stream the files to MetaDefender Core as part of the upload
process.

## File Analysis Process

  MetaDefender's main functionality is to analyze large volumes with a high throughput. Depending on the configuration and licensed technologies, the analysis times can vary. 
  Below is a brief description of the API integration flow:

  1. Upload a file for analysis (`POST /file`), which returns the `data_id`: [File Analysis](/mdcore/metadefender-core/ref#fileanalysispost)).
    
    > _**Note**:_ The performance depends on:
    > - number of nodes (scaling)
    > - number of engines per node
    > - type of file to be scanned
    > - Metadefender Core and nodes' hardware
  

  2. You have 2 ways to retrieve the analysis report: 
    - **Polling**: Fetch the result with previously received data_id (`GET /file/{data_id}` resource) until scan result belonging to data_id doesn't reach the 100 percent progress_percentage: ([Fetch analysis result](/mdcore/metadefender-core/ref#fileanalysisget))
  
    > _**Note**:_ Too many data_id requests can reduce performance. It is enough to just check every few hundred milliseconds.
    
    - **Callbackurl**: Specify a callbackurl that will be called once the analysis is complete. 

  3. Retrieve the analysis results anytime after the analysis is completed with hash for files (md5, sha1, sha256) by calling [Fetch analysis result by hash](/mdcore/metadefender-core/ref#hashget).
    - The hash can be found in the scan results

  4. Retrieve processed file (sanitized, redacted, watermarked, etc.) after the analysis is complete. 
    > _**Note**:_ Based on the configured retention policy, the files might be available for retrieval at a later time.

      version = "0.10.0"
    }
  }
}
